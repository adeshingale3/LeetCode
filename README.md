# LeetCode Daily Practice

Welcome to my **Daily LeetCode Practice Repository**! ðŸ’¡ðŸ’»

## About This Repository
This repository is my daily log of practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. My goal is to:
- **Sharpen my problem-solving skills**
- **Stay consistent with coding**
- **Build a habit of tackling challenges daily**

Every day, I'll be solving problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and uploading my solutions here. This not only helps me track my progress but also keeps me actively motivated to improve and maintain my GitHub presence.

## Why This Journey Matters
DSA is the backbone of computer science and is essential for cracking technical interviews and building efficient solutions. By practicing consistently, I'm aiming to:
- Enhance my understanding of fundamental concepts.
- Develop optimized solutions for real-world problems.
- Stay accountable in my learning journey.

## Repository Structure
Each solution is organized in the following format:
- **Problem Title**: The filename matches the problem title for easy reference.
- **Code**: Solutions are implemented in Java with proper comments.

## How You Can Help
- **Suggestions**: Feel free to suggest alternative solutions or optimizations.
- **Discussions**: Open an issue if you'd like to discuss a particular problem or approach.

## Motivation Quote
> *"Consistency is more important than perfection. Every step forward, no matter how small, counts."*

Join me as I embark on this journey to master DSA and grow as a developer. Letâ€™s code and learn together! ðŸ“šðŸ“Š
